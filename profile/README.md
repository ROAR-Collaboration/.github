## Hi there 👋

This repo is to organize the projects and subteams for Berkeley's [106/206B](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106b-sp23site/) collaboration

The four project groups are as follows:

- [group1-tracker](https://github.com/ROAR-Collaboration/group1-tracker)
- [group2-controls](https://github.com/ROAR-Collaboration/group2-controls)
- [group3-SLAM](https://github.com/ROAR-Collaboration/group3-SLAM)
- [group4-plannine](https://github.com/ROAR-Collaboration/group4-planning)

In each repo you should find getting started docs and instructions on how to spin up and interact with a ROS bag from the actual Indy Race. The repos are decoupled code for your individual projects, if you encounter issues please let us know, or use the discord to reach out to the team for help. 

Some students should additionally have access to the [AI Racing Tech Repo](https://github.com/airacingtech)is you've requested it, this repo contains the full race stack. There is a current [tutorial video](https://ai-racing-tech-race-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/docs/getting_started/run_on_ossdc.html) to spin up and use an open source OSDCC/LGSVL hacked simulator. Note this requires access to a 3080/3090 GPU. There is a lab computer in Cory for shared use. 

We are additionally in the process of securing some distributed AWS access to allow students to run their ROS code locally and interact with the Simulator as an AWS instance for testing purposes.
